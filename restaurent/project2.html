            A website provides hotels with the opportunity to receive direct bookings from guests. By offering an online booking system, hotels can bypass third-party booking platforms and avoid paying commissions. 
            A well-designed website allows hotels to establish their unique brand identity and stand out from the competition. Through visually appealing designs, high-quality images, and engaging content, hotels can showcase their distinct features, ambiance, and overall guest experience.
